        <img src={image14} alt="Library Renovation" />
        
            <p>We are delighted to share the outcomes of a highly productive Leaders’ Forum convened by Garissa University, bringing together the Members of Parliament, Principal Secretaries, and the Council and Management of the University. The forum aimed to explore strategies for promoting, enhancing, and expanding university education in the North Eastern region.<br></br><br></br>

The meeting engaged in crucial discussions on fostering collaboration between the leadership of the North Eastern region and Garissa University. The primary focus was on devising strategies to extend the reach of university education to Wajir and Mandera Counties through the development of new facilities, the expansion of infrastructure, and the allocation of resources to ensure the seamless integration of university education into these Counties.<br></br><br></br>

Recognizing the importance of ongoing projects at the university, the forum prioritized the swift completion of the New Tuition Block, Library Complex, and Administration Block to enhance the university’s capacity to provide quality education and facilitate a conducive learning environment for students.<br></br><br></br>

The forum underscored the importance of aligning academic offerings with the unique needs of the North Eastern region and proposed the development of tailored academic programmes. Key areas for programme development were identified, including Health Sciences, Agriculture, Law, Engineering, and others, reflecting a commitment to address the specific demands and opportunities of the region.<br></br><br></br>

While acknowledging the financial challenges faced by some students, the leaders stressed the urgency of providing scholarship and bursary support. A collective pledge was made to assist struggling students from respective constituencies to enrol at Garissa University. This commitment reaffirms our shared dedication to making quality education accessible to all deserving individuals.<br></br><br></br>

In a display of resolute commitment, the leaders pledged support for resource mobilization efforts. This support extends beyond financial contributions and includes collaboration with County and National governments as well as engagement with local and global institutions. The aim is to secure the necessary resources to advance the development and expansion of higher education in the North Eastern region. To ensure effective mobilization of resources, a sub-committee, comprising six members from the North Eastern Parliamentary Group, will be constituted to spearhead the effort.<br></br><br></br>

Garissa University has been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing a Master Plan to guide the future growth and development of the institution. This strategic document will be instrumental in ensuring that our infrastructure and resources align seamlessly with our vision for academic excellence.<br></br><br></br>

Garissa University Council and Management express sincere gratitude for the unwavering commitment demonstrated by the leaders. Together, we aim to foster collaborative efforts that will propel the institution towards greater heights of excellence and community service.<br></br><br></br>
