<p>8. <strong>Why is it that a book is indicated as available in the database, but cannot be traced on the shelves?</strong> Our library is open-shelf and some readers leave books around, which results in this situation. Please ask for clarification at the circulation desk.</p>

<p>14. <strong>Is it possible to stop fines from accruing in my account when I lose a library item meanwhile as I look for it?</strong> Yes. But for this to be effected, you need to report immediately the item is lost. Contact the Librarian for more details.</p>
<p>15. <strong>I returned a Library Information Material some time ago but I have just received an overdue notice. What should I do?</strong> Every item checked out under your account means that you are liable and subsequently responsible for the item/s checked out under your account. Therefore, you are required to take care of them. Make sure you return the same properly. However, check your account regularly and inform the Librarian immediately of any inconsistency.</p>
<p>16. <strong>I received an alert notice that an item on my account is now overdue and accruing fines.   What do I do?</strong> If you still have the item in your possession, kindly return it! You will be charged a fine if you don’t.</p>
<p>17. <strong>What should I do if the item listed as ‘available’, cannot be found on the open shelves?</strong> In most cases, another user may be consulting it; check the reading tables next to the first shelves of every floor of the library.
